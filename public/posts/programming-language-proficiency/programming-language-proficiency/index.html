Whilst reading Ultralearning by Scott H. Young I began thinking about how we learn programming languages.
My language project right now is to learn Go (this site is built on Hugo, a Go static site framework!) to the point
where I can program fairly complex software &amp; services in it, ideally to the level I can use Python. When learning anything,
the first hurdle becomes direction - where do I go and when to maximise my learning whilst minimising the roadblocks,
frustrations, and confusion that comes with big learning curve leaps or non-linear learning paths. If you&rsquo;re lost, you&rsquo;re
not learning.">

<p>Whilst reading <em>Ultralearning</em> by Scott H. Young I began thinking about how we learn programming languages.</p>
<p>My language project right now is to learn Go (this site is built on Hugo, a Go static site framework!) to the point
where I can program fairly complex software &amp; services in it, ideally to the level I can use Python. When learning anything,
the first hurdle becomes <strong>direction</strong> - where do I go and when to maximise my learning whilst minimising the roadblocks,
frustrations, and confusion that comes with big learning curve leaps or non-linear learning paths. If you&rsquo;re lost, you&rsquo;re
not learning.</p>
<p><em>Ultralearning</em> opens with a story about a man called Benny Lewis forcing himself to learn human languages to a
conversational, sometimes almost fluent, level within 3 months. How does he measure his goals? Well, human language
has the massive advantage of having entire institutions setup for its learning, and these institutions provide <strong>language
proficiency levels</strong>. These are <em>A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2</em>, increasing in proficiency from left to right. It&rsquo;s called the
<strong>CEFR Scale</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/CEFR.jpg" alt="CEFR Scale"></p>
<p>All widely spoken languages are measured in these levels. Exams are taken to reach each level, admined by an
institution for each language</p>
